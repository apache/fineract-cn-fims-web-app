## Versioning
The version numbers follow the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) scheme.

In addition to MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH the following postfixes are used to indicate the development state.

* snapshot - A release currently in development. 
* m - A _milestone_ release include specific sets of functions and are released as soon as the functionality is complete.
* rc - A _release candidate_ is a version with potential to be a final product, considered _code complete_.
* ga - _General availability_ indicates that this release is the best available version and is recommended for all usage.

The versioning layout is {MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}-{INDICATOR}[.{PATCH}]. Only milestones and release candidates can  have patch versions. Some examples:
